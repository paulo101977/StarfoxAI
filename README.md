This project showcases how an AI agent learns to play *Star Fox* using **Stable-Baselines3**, **OpenAI Gym**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The AI starts with no knowledge, struggles in the beginning, but gradually improves to take on the first boss!

## ðŸŽ® Overview
- The AI initially flies in a straight line without strategic movement.
- Modifications were made to the **reward system**, **neural network size**, and **action discretizer** to enhance learning.
- After several training iterations, the AI starts maneuvering better and engaging in combat.
- The AI eventually reaches the **first boss**, but still lacks full battle proficiency due to missing environmental details (like enemy health bars).
- Future improvements could refine decision-making and combat awareness.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Stable-Baselines3** ðŸ§ 
- **OpenAI Gym** ðŸ¤–
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** âš¡
- **Python & PyTorch** ðŸ”¥
- **Retro Gaming AI Training** ðŸŽ®

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning** applied to a classic game.
- **AI decision-making improvements** over time.
- **Custom reward system** to encourage strategic flying and combat.
- **Future enhancements** planned for boss fight efficiency.
